# Bidirectional-Attendance-System-with-visitor-Counter-Simulation
A simulation of the attendance system based on the Aurdino UNO microcontroller was made using Tinker cad.Â The system reduced false attendance. It can count the number of students/employees in the hall/classroom and record their presence during a session. It shows movement type and student count.
